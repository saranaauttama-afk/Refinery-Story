# Refinery Story — Roadmap

Living plan for the game's design + balance direction. Status markers:
`✅ done` · `🚧 in progress` · `⏳ planned`. Newest work is tracked here;
deep implementation notes still live in `README.md`.

Verify every change with `npx tsc --noEmit`. There is no automated test suite;
isolated `node -e` sims + the web-export screenshot loop are the verification tools.

## Recently shipped (UI legibility + cleanup pass)

Merged to `devMobile` via PR #3. All `tsc`-clean + screenshot-verified (EN/TH).

- ✅ **Flow-rate HUD bar** — a strip under the resource dock shows **net $/min**
  and **output/min** with a profit/loss/idle dot, derived from real state deltas
  over a rolling ~30s tick window (`useGameLoop`) so it reflects every system
  (market / morale / specialization) and freezes on pause.
- ✅ **Full bilingual (EN/TH)** — every gameplay tab (factory + contracts /
  supply / recruit / research / company) now goes through `useLang()`'s `t()`;
  new string blocks in `translations.ts` (`hud`, `nav`, per-screen blocks,
  `eventsSheet`, `hiddenEventBanner`). (Event-log content still mixed.)
- ✅ **HUD declutter** — dock trimmed to 4 core stats (money / crude / gas /
  rep); ESG / morale / specialization / feedstock / season / era moved into the
  "More Info" sheet, with an alert dot when ESG or morale drops low.
- ✅ **Dedicated R&D tab** — Research + Perks pulled out of the Company hub into
  their own `research.tsx` tab (🔬), one tap from the bottom nav.
- ✅ **Shared `ScreenHeader`** + a guiding empty state on Contracts; fixed the
  hidden-event banner/nav that pointed at the removed Business/Staff tabs.
- ✅ **Dead-code removal (~3.7k lines)** — five unregistered legacy screens, two
  unused factory-view components, and the two dev prototype routes.
- ✅ **Event-system consolidation** — cut 12 trivial auto-apply random events
  (free resources / no decision); kept the four real incidents as an ESG-gated,
  safety-officer-mitigated managed risk. Decisions now live in the choice pool.
- ✅ **Art-slot pipeline** — `ArtSlot` + `src/art/registry.ts` render labelled
  placeholders for raster art that can't be code-drawn; `ASSETS_NEEDED.md` is the
  artist's spec sheet. Drop a PNG in `assets/art/` + register one line to swap in.

---

## Recently shipped (game-feel + UX pass)

- ✅ **Bug fixes** — hidden-event `staff` reward now updates `workerCounts`;
  `completeContract` refactored out of 7-deep ternaries; `applyAutoTrade`
  reuses precomputed `DerivedStats`.
- ✅ **Living map** — plants puff smoke while actually producing
  (`PlantSmoke`); a delivery truck drives across the yard on each trade
  (`DeliveryTruck`).
- ✅ **Juice** — confetti bursts on milestone / win / combo / S–A year
  (`Confetti`); year-end `AwardModal` is an animated reveal ceremony.
- ✅ **Sound** — `expo-audio` system with guarded playback + a "Sound effects"
  setting; SFX wired to buy/sell/build + celebration chimes. Ships short
  placeholder WAVs (drop nicer files over `assets/audio/*`). BGM is a no-op
  until a track is added (`sounds.ts` `BGM_SOURCE`).
- ✅ **Custom font** — Baloo 2 loaded at startup, applied to hero UI text.
- ✅ **HUD redesign** — persistent money/crude/gas/ESG/rep bar (no longer
  covered by event banners, which moved below via `OVERLAY_BANNER_TOP`);
  debug tile labels hidden; persistent bottom nav bar replacing the hamburger
  FAB; factory grid dropped down off the HUD (`GRID_DROP`).
- ✅ **Pause-model time + speed control** — crude shipments are tick-based (no
  more wall-clock), folded into the main tick; a speed pill cycles
  1× / 2× / 3× / ⏸ (drives the tick interval period). Pure pause model: closing
  the app freezes everything, no offline progress (the Kairosoft model).

## Balance tuning (from the economy audit)

Findings (see audit): downstream margins (2.5–5×) dwarf gasoline (1.8×) so
later products obsolete earlier ones; late-game money inflates because sinks
are weak; tier-1 contracts don't beat spot-selling.

- ✅ **P0 — Contract rewards** — tier-1 contracts now clearly beat spot
  gasoline ($22–24/unit vs $18).
- ✅ **P0 — Ongoing money sink** — annual building maintenance
  (`MAINTENANCE_BALANCE`) deducted at year-end, shown in the ceremony.
- ✅ **P1 — Margin compression** — handled structurally by the Dynamic Market's
  demand saturation (over-producing one product crashes its own price).

---

## Feature roadmap (design direction)

Ordered by impact. The throughline: the game is mechanically rich but light on
*recurring decisions* and *tension that forces choices*. These add both.

### 1. 🥇 Dynamic market (`✅ shipped` — flagship)
Crude spot price swings on a deterministic wave (buy when cheap); each product
has demand saturation that drops on selling and recovers over time, so flooding
one product tanks its own price. Surfaced in the trade panel (live crude price
+ cheap/high hint). Resolves the margin-gap balance item structurally.
Follow-ups: a fuller market panel/price graph; expose saturation per product in
the sell UI; tie crude waves to events (supply shocks).

### 2. 🥈 Specialization / forced tradeoffs (`✅ shipped`)
Permanent one-time choice at refinery Level 5 between Green and Industrial paths.
**Green** — ESG regen ×1.5, sell price +10% eco-premium, wages −20%, year-end
reputation +15, but production −10%. **Industrial** — production output +15%,
crude storage +25%, contract cash +20%, maintenance −25%, but ESG decay ×1.3.
Triggered via the ChoiceEvent modal on upgrade; shown as a badge in the HUD.
Save-safe (old saves default to no specialization).

### 3. 🥉 Layout / adjacency as a first-class system (`🚧 in progress`)
- ✅ **Negative adjacency** — a lab / sales office adjacent to a heavy
  polluting plant loses 50% of its bonus (`LAYOUT_BALANCE`), surfaced as a
  warning line in the tile info sheet. Makes placement a tradeoff.
- ⏳ Follow-ups: visible synergy auras on the map, more positive combo types.

### 4. People / morale layer (`✅ shipped`)
Global `staffMorale` (0–100) drifts toward equilibrium each tick. High morale
(>75) gives workers a 10% effectiveness bonus; low morale (<40) applies a 15%
penalty — the multiplier flows through `workerProductionMultiplier` transparently.
Morale reacts to: employee level-ups (+3), hires (+2), retirements (−5), unpaid
wages (−15), year-end grade (S/A: +8, C: −5), and 4 dedicated staff choice
events (Standout Hire, Team Feud, Raise Request, Team Outing) that fire on their
own ~6-minute cooldown once you have 3+ employees. Shown in the HUD resource
dock and the year-end ceremony.

### 5. Endgame / prestige spine (`✅ shipped`)
A ladder of 6 "legacy goals" (`ENDGAME_GOALS`: max level, $1M, all research,
max grid, an S-grade year, 100k lifetime gasoline) shown on the Achievements
screen with progress bars. Completing all flips `legendAchieved` → the
"Industry Legend" celebration (modal + confetti). Closes the post-Lv20 loop.
Follow-up: ✅ **New Game+ / Prestige** — once Industry Legend is reached, the
Company › Settings tab offers Prestige: a fresh run that carries a permanent
stacking +10%/level production bonus (`PRESTIGE_BALANCE`, `prestigeGame`).

## Execution order

1. Docs + roadmap (this file, `CLAUDE.md`). ✅
2. Balance P0 (contracts + maintenance sink).
3. Dynamic Market (feature 1) — also resolves balance P1.
4. Specialization (2) → Layout (3) → People (4) → Endgame (5).
